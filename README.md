Summary of Requirements and Goals
The inventory tracking app was developed to address the user need for an efficient way to manage and track inventory items. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily add, update, delete, and view inventory items. This app is particularly beneficial for small business owners or individuals who need to keep track of their stock levels and ensure timely restocking.

User-Centered UI Design
To support user needs, several screens and features were incorporated into the app. The main screens included:

Login Screen: Allows users to securely log in or create a new account.
Dashboard Screen: Displays an overview of current inventory items in a grid format.
Add/Edit Item Screen: Enables users to input details for new items or modify existing ones.
Settings Screen: Provides options for notifications and user preferences.
The UI design was centered around simplicity and accessibility. For instance, using clear labels and intuitive navigation ensured that users could quickly understand how to interact with the app. The success of these designs was evident in user testing feedback, which indicated high satisfaction with the appâ€™s layout and functionality.

Coding Approach and Strategies
During the coding process, I adopted a modular approach, breaking down the application into manageable components. I started by implementing core features, such as user authentication and database interaction, before moving on to the UI. Using version control through Git helped maintain a clear history of changes and facilitated collaboration. In future projects, I will continue to use modular design and version control, as they streamline the development process and make debugging easier.

Testing for Functionality
I utilized the Android Emulator to test the app's functionality throughout the development process. This included checking user authentication, database operations, and SMS notification permissions. Testing is crucial as it ensures that the app works as intended and allows for the identification of bugs early in the development cycle. This process revealed areas where user input validation was necessary and led to improvements in error handling.

Innovation in the Development Process
Throughout the app design and development process, I encountered several challenges, particularly in integrating the SQLite database with the user interface. I had to innovate by researching different approaches to asynchronous database operations, which ultimately led to a more responsive app. This experience taught me the value of flexibility and creativity in problem-solving.

Demonstrating Knowledge, Skills, and Experience
I was particularly successful in implementing the user authentication and database functionalities, showcasing my understanding of secure coding practices and data management. This experience reinforced my skills in developing fully functional mobile applications and highlighted the importance of user-centered design.
